Hi there, I’m Hasan 👋

I’m a Bachelor of Software Engineering and a Front‑End‑leaning Full‑Stack developer. I build modern web apps with Next.js / React.js, ship reliable UIs with TypeScript, and wire up APIs with Node.js. I’m currently diving deeper into Machine Learning (Python, scikit‑learn, TensorFlow basics) to blend ML with practical web products.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js · Next.js · TypeScript · JavaScript (ES202x) · HTML · CSS · Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js · Express · REST · Basic GraphQL · MongoDB · PostgreSQL (basics)

Dev Tools: Git & GitHub · Vite · Webpack · ESLint/Prettier · Docker (basics)

ML (learning): Python · NumPy · Pandas · scikit‑learn · TensorFlow/Keras (intro)

I enjoy translating product ideas into accessible, responsive, and fast experiences.

🎯 What I’m focusing on

Building data‑driven apps with Next.js (App Router) + API Routes

Exploring ML‑powered features (recommendations, classification) for web projects

Clean component architecture, accessibility (a11y), and performance

✨ Quick Highlights

Frontend‑first, with practical backend experience

Comfortable shipping end‑to‑end features (UI → API → DB)

Learning ML to create useful, intelligent product features
